--- CPU Types

All CPU types are the following:
  - x86 (32-bit) : Intel or AMD. Commonly used in desktops and laptops.
  - x86-64 (64-bit): Intel or AMD. This is an extension of the x86 instruction set. Commonly used in desktops and laptops.
  - ARM (32-bit and 64-bit): Commonly used in embedded systems, mobile devices, etc. Eg. ARMv7 and ARMv8 (64-bit).
  - MIPS (32-bit and 64-bit): Commonly used in older router devices and some embedded systems.
  - PowerPC (32-bit and 64-bit): Commonly used in older Apple computers and some non-Apple systems.
  - RISC-V (32-bit and 64-bit): Relatively new open standard that has gained popularity for use in embedded systems and some servers.

*Note: Linux kernel supported all these CPU types.
