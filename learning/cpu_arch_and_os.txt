OPERATING SYSTEM & CPU ARCHITECTURES



--- CPU architectures

All CPU architectures are the following:
  - x86 (32-bit): Commonly used in desktops and laptops.
  - x86-64/AMD64 (64-bit): Introduced in 2003 (from Intel's Pentium 4). Extends x86 instruction set. Commonly used in desktops and laptops.
  - ARM   (32-bit): Commonly used in embedded systems, mobile devices, etc.
  - ARM64 (64-bit): Introduced in 2011 (from ARMv8). Commonly used in embedded systems, mobile devices, etc.
  - MIPS  (32-bit and 64-bit): Commonly used in older router devices and some embedded systems.
  - PowerPC (32-bit and 64-bit): Commonly used in older Apple computers and some non-Apple systems.
  - RISC-V  (32-bit and 64-bit): Relatively new open standard that has gained popularity for use in embedded systems and some servers.
  - Apple CPU architectures:
    - Apple M1    (ARM64-based): Introduced in 2020 (from macOS Big Sur). Commonly used in Mac and iPad.
    - Apple A4-14 (ARM32-based): Commonly used in iPhone.
    - Apple A15   (ARM64-based): Introduced in 2020 (from iPad mini & iPad Air 4). Commonly used in iPad.

*Note: Linux kernel supported all these CPU architectures.



--- Operating System

Windows (Acer, Dell, HP, etc)
  - x86   (32-bit)
  - x86-64/AMD64 (64-bit): Since 2003 (from Intel's Pentium 4)

--- Definitions

The terms "CPU types" and "CPU architectures" are often used interchangeably, but they do have slightly different meanings.
  - CPU types also known as instruction set architectures (ISAs), are the specific set of instructions and operations that a CPU can understand and execute. For example, Intel and AMD processors have different ISAs.
  - CPU architectures refer to the overall design of a CPU, including the organization of its components and how they work together. This includes details such as the number of cores, cache memory, and how data is processed and moved between components.
